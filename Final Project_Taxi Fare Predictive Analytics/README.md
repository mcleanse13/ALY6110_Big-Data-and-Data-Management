This project investigates predictive analytics in the taxi service sector, with a primary focus on accurately forecasting taxi fares. Using a comprehensive dataset containing trip distances, toll amounts, and related fare components, we employed a structured methodology encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, and evaluation. Through this process, we aimed to uncover the key factors influencing fare amounts and assess the predictive power of different regression models, providing actionable insights for operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

Three regression models were analyzed: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Linear Regression offered simplicity and interpretability, Random Forest captured complex non-linear relationships, and Gradient Boosting progressively refined predictions through error correction. Feature importance analyses revealed that fare amount, tip amount, and tolls amount consistently drove predictions across all models. Model performance metrics—including R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)—demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with Linear Regression providing the best balance of simplicity and precision for this dataset.

The project also included visualizations highlighting temporal and behavioral patterns in taxi usage, surcharges, and payment methods. Key insights include the influence of trip distance and surcharges on fares, peak usage times, and customer payment preferences. Based on these findings, we recommend continued use of linear regression for similar datasets, cautious application of more complex models, and enhanced data collection for improved predictive accuracy. Future research could explore incorporating real-time variables, validating models on larger datasets, and developing dynamic fare prediction systems for operational optimization.
