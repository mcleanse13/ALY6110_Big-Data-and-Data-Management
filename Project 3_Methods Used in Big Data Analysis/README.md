This project explores practical applications of big data analysis using Apache Hadoop through lab exercises in Cloudera. The module focuses on connecting to a Cloudera VM via Hyper-V, navigating the system, and performing data analysis tasks to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. Key exercises included calculating total revenue per product across all years, identifying top revenue-generating products for the latest year, and analyzing products that are frequently viewed but not purchased. By completing these tasks, the project demonstrates the use of Hadoop functions and SQL-based queries to manage, process, and analyze big datasets effectively.

The lab emphasizes not only technical skills but also the ability to interpret results and explain the analysis process. Through the queries executed, the project identified top-performing products, revenue rankings, and anomalies in customer behavior, such as highly viewed products that were never purchased. These insights provide an understanding of consumer trends and sales performance while showcasing the practical application of big data technologies for decision-making. The exercises also highlight problem-solving techniques when handling real-world data, including strategies for working with incomplete or complex datasets.
