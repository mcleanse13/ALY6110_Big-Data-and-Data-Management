This project introduces fundamental concepts of Big Data and the key frameworks used in analytical projects. The module focuses on understanding the Four V’s of Big Data—Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity—and how they influence data collection, storage, and analysis. Additionally, it emphasizes identifying real-world problems that can be addressed through Big Data solutions and selecting appropriate large datasets to support such analysis. The module lays the groundwork for practical experience with Big Data platforms, providing students with the knowledge to navigate and utilize these tools effectively in subsequent projects.

The hands-on lab component involves setting up and starting Cloudera QuickStart either on an Azure Virtual Machine or a local VMWare installation. Students are required to document the installation and successful startup of all services with screenshots and timestamps, ensuring familiarity with managing Big Data environments. This practical exercise reinforces the theoretical concepts introduced in the module, giving students experience in preparing and working with enterprise-level Big Data platforms as a foundation for future analytical tasks.
