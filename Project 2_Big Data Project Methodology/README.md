This project explores the use of Big Data in public sector decision-making through a case study of New York City’s adoption of data-driven governance strategies. The module introduces Apache Hadoop technology and emphasizes the ethical use of data, tracing its application in real-world decision-making scenarios. By examining initiatives such as Compstat in the NYPD and the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), the project demonstrates how integrated datasets from multiple agencies can improve resource allocation, enhance efficiency, and address challenges ranging from crime reduction to fire prevention and Medicaid fraud. The analysis highlights the complexities of data integration, centralization versus decentralization, and modernization of outdated systems, showcasing the practical benefits and challenges of leveraging Big Data for municipal management.

Through this case study, the project identifies key issues in data usage, including the balance between centralized and decentralized approaches, integration of diverse datasets, and the need for standardized protocols across city agencies. Recommendations emphasize sustaining MODA’s initiatives, modernizing the FDNY inspection system, and creating a unified database for seamless inter-agency data sharing. The project illustrates how structured analysis of large datasets can inform governance, optimize decision-making, and promote transparency while ensuring ethical and secure handling of sensitive data.
