This project focuses on leveraging Apache Spark to analyze large-scale housing datasets using the SparklyR library in R. Two datasets were examined: annual house price indexes (HPI) by five-digit ZIP codes and median home values from Zillow’s Home Value Index (ZHVI). The project involved importing, cleaning, and exploring these datasets in Spark, performing summary statistics, correlation analyses, and various visualizations to better understand housing trends across the United States. By applying these techniques, the project demonstrates how Spark can efficiently process large datasets, enabling the discovery of meaningful patterns and insights.

The analysis revealed key trends in housing prices over time and across regions. For the HPI dataset, comparisons between the 1990 and 2000 base indexes indicated slight differences influenced by the number and age of homes, while correlation analyses highlighted relationships between variables such as year of construction and price appreciation. The Zillow dataset analysis identified states with the highest peak housing values, illustrating geographical patterns and temporal trends influenced by economic events. Overall, this project showcases the practical application of Spark for data-driven insights in real estate, combining statistical methods, visualizations, and time-series analyses to answer focused business questions.
