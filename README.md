# ALY6110_Big-Data-and-Data-Management

This series of projects in ALY 6110 focused on applying big data methodologies and tools—including Hadoop, Spark, and SparklyR in R—to analyze large and complex datasets. Across the six modules, the assignments emphasized data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling. Projects ranged from analyzing taxi ride datasets to exploring housing price indices and Zillow home values, providing hands-on experience in using big data frameworks to extract insights, identify patterns, and solve real-world problems. Each project involved structured workflows including data cleaning, outlier treatment, correlation analysis, and leveraging both statistical and machine learning techniques to answer targeted business questions.

The projects progressively built skills in predictive analytics, streaming data processing, and dashboard creation, with practical applications such as fare prediction for taxi services, housing price trend analysis, and understanding patterns in home values. Key tools and techniques included regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), Spark jobs for distributed data processing, and visualizations to communicate insights. Collectively, these projects demonstrate the integration of big data analytics methodologies with actionable insights, equipping students with the technical and analytical skills required for data-driven decision-making in real-world scenarios.
